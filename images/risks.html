    Cybersecurity risk is the probability of exposure through loss of sensitive infomation from a cyber attack or breach of data within an organization's network. A cyber attack is a malicious assault launched by hackers with the intent to damage, steal, and disrupt a computer network or system though the use of using computers. It is estimated that 68% of business leaders feel their cybersecurity risks are increasing (Sobers, 2021). Cybercriminals establishes numerous practices to pursue their attacks via malware, phishing, key-loggers, denial-of-service attack and other methods. With the latest statistics showing a cyberattack is attempted every 39 seconds (Graphus, 2021). It is important to understand the risks that follows when it comes to the digital world of technology.

  Any individual or company that uses the internet could become a prime candidate for cyber criminals due to the increased reliances on computers, networks, programs, social media and data. As a result, any infomation stored in your devices might be deemed worthy for cyber criminals to take hold of. With the cybersecurity industry exponentially increasing every day, more and more resoures are required to meet and counter the scale of modern cyber attacks.

  Phishing is reguarded as one of the most common and unpleasant hacking techniques where cybercriminals impersonate legitmate organisations in order to obtain sensitive infomation. As 75 percent of organizations around the world experienced some kind of phishing attack in 2020 (Graphus, 2021). According to reports from Akamai (2019) it shows that "cybercriminals are targeting top global brands and their users across various industries through highly-organized and sophisticated phishing kit operations". Additionally this enables cyber criminals to advance from email-based threats to other platforms including social media and mobile devices
