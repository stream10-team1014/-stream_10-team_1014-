Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations (Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommedations) 
</h2>

<p>
	The use of technology is vastly accepted throughout modern society as it has revolutionized the world and in people’s day-to-day lives. People have adapted to technology as it makes their life easier, convenient, safer and entertaining. It also changed the way of how they communicate through the use of the Internet enabling people to share data and seek information in a matter of seconds. However, this can lead to exposure of cyber-attacks which is mounted through cyberspace. This is because it is hard to visualize how digital signals are travelled across a wire representing an attack.
</p>

<p>
	 A problem that modern society faces with technology are reported data breaches due to cybercriminals gaining unauthorized access to victim’s computer system or network through stealing private, sensitive, or confidential personal and financial data. According to the Ponemon Institute’s 2018 Cost of a Data Breach study, a data breach goes undiscovered for an average of 197 days (Malwarebytes, 2021). It is a problem that knows no borders and that can take on different forms. Although cyberspace is not a physical phenomenon it is a potential platform for cybercriminals to use as a digital weaponry with some being quite serious; potentially threatening human lives. On the contrary, cybercrime countermeasures are constantly updated and implemented in modern society in order to combat cyber-crime and increase security. 
</p> 

<p>
	 New legislation and regulations have also been implemented to combat the changing landscape - protecting businesses and citizens. People can become victims of theft of account and credit card details via e-mails that appear to come from their banks. Social platform attacks target websites with large user bases, such as Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram. A good approach prevents social media breaches, protect user information, and secure company data, increased vigilance by individual users and enterprise policies are the best ways to ensure data breaches are avoided.
</p>

<p>	
	In my opinion, users in cyberspace struggle to monitor/protect their digital footprint due to the sheer number of cybercriminals and their advancements. Nowadays, all digital devices (including computers, tablets, and smartphones) are connected to the internet enabling cybercriminals to utilize a variety of cyberattacks through the form of DDoS, phishing, identity theft, or even malware. This affects us on a global scale however it is possible to cover up your digital footprint and it can be done in many ways. A good mindset is to always value your personal information, be cautious about what and where you publish, think and manage who can look up your profile, and even evaluating the impact it could have when posting.
