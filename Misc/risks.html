  <h3>
    What is cybersecurity risk?

  Cybersecurity risk is the probability of exposure through loss of sensitive infomation from a cyber attack or breach of data within an organization's network. A cyber attack is a malicious assault launched by hackers with the intent to damage, steal, and disrupt a computer network or system though the use of using computers. Any individual or company that uses the internet could become a prime candidate for cyber criminals. It is estimated that 68% of business leaders feel their cybersecurity risks are increasing (Sobers, 2021). Cybercriminals establishes numerous practices to pursue their attacks via malware, phishing, key-loggers, denial-of-service attack and other methods. With the latest statistics showing a cyberattack is attempted every 39 seconds (Graphus, 2021). It is important to understand the risks that follows when it comes to the digital world of technology.

   Industries that are most vulnrable to cyberattacks involves small businesses, healthcare institutions, government agencies 
   Many industries are vulnerable to cyberattacks, but some are more vulnerable than others due to the sheer nature of their business. Although there is a common misconception that small businesses are rarely a target for cybercriminals, realistically any industry could be subject to a data breach. Industries that are most vulnerable to cyber attack include - 

   <div>
    <p>
      • Small businesses
    </p>
    <p>
      • Healthcare institutions
    </p>
    <p>
      • Government agencies
    </p>
    <p>
      • Energy companies
    </p>
    <p>
      • Higher education facilities
    </p>
   </div>

  This is because of the increased reliances on computers, networks, programs, social media and data files. With the cybersecurity industry exponentially increasing every day, more and more resoures are required to meet and counter the scale of modern cyber attacks. As a result, any infomation stored in your devices might be deemed worthy for cyber criminals to take hold of. 
</p>

<p>
  Phishing is considered as one of the most common and unpleasant hacking techniques where cybercriminals impersonate legitmate organisations in order to obtain sensitive infomation. As 75 percent of organizations around the world experienced some kind of phishing attack in 2020 (Graphus, 2021). According to reports from Akamai (2019) it shows that "cybercriminals are targeting top global brands and their users across various industries through highly-organized and sophisticated phishing kit operations". Additionally this enables cyber criminals to advance from email-based threats to other platforms including social media and mobile devices

<p>
  DDoS short for Denial-of-Service Attack is a special type of cybercrime and is reguarded as a hostile type of attack from cybercriminals with the intent to disrupt normal traffic flow of a targeted server, sevice or networks. These attacks are primarly used to prevent and stop the users inputs by flooding their machine or resource systems - overloading their devices with unnecessary requests. Another variation type of DoS attack includes Crash attacks which involves cybercriminals to infect a system with bugs - crashing it rendering the user incapable of using online services. Attackers uses these kind of cybercrime to coerce money from vulnerable organizations or to carry out, cover up, and prepare for other criminal activities. Not only DDoS attacks enables to Attackers

  Malware is a malicious software specifically designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer system with varying damage capabilities. It is the fastest-growing method of cyberattack and is estimated to expand in the coming years expecting to reach $6 trillion in 2021 (CDNetworks, 2021). It is estimated that 94% of malware is delivered through emails due to the fact that they are typically installed on a computer when a user clicks on links, downloads, malicious attachments or opening rogue software programs (Jovanović, 2021). Malware infected machines usually deceives the users into clicking or installing programs which can infect personal computers, smartphones, tablets or servers. Different types of malware consist of spyware, trojan, virus, ransomware and other more hybrid attacks. They are able to execute malicious actions without the user’s authorization performing actions such as -

    • Self-replication all-round the file system

  <p>
    • Installing programs such as key-loggers
  </p>
  <p>
    • Blocking the users access to their files
  </p>
  <p>
    • Barraging the user with ads
  </p>
  <p>
    • Damaging essential system components
