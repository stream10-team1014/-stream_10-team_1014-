As society , business and individuals are moving towards total reliance on the internet, especially in a post-covid world, the threat and damages of cyberattacks will only grow.
Businesses will by necessity need to focus more time and money on security, as the duties and responsibilities regarding cybersecurity may move onto businesses and governments
in order to protect customers/citizens. Even businesses who previously felt they did not need to pay any attention to cybersecurity will by necessity have to make significant 
choices. Smart infrastructure, Internet of Things/Internet of Everything, Big Data / Cloud computing, Wearable Tech,
 Integrated ICT Systems in Personal Health and Government records and communications, all point to a move towards a necessity to consider cybersecurity much more seriously.
