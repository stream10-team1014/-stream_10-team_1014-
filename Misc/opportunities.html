As society , business and individuals are moving towards total reliance on the internet, especially in a post-covid world, the threat and damages of cyberattacks will only grow. <br>
Businesses will by necessity need to focus more time and money on security, as the duties and responsibilities regarding cybersecurity may move onto businesses and governments<br>
in order to protect customers/citizens. Even businesses who previously felt they did not need to pay any attention to cybersecurity will by necessity have to make significant <br>
choices. Smart infrastructure, Internet of Things/Internet of Everything, Big Data / Cloud computing, Wearable Tech, Integrated ICT Systems in Personal Health and Government<br>
