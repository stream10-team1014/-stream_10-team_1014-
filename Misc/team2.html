<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>
<p>
Technology and especially computer systems and networks are increasingly becoming a part of the fabric of our individual lives. For our everyday lives, <br>
interactions with government, business, leisure, personal information, leisure, study and certification and basically any area you can think of, we are<br>
 using computer information systems to do what we do. Technology is growing and changing and in turn changing our lives, faster than lawmakers and <br>
 security professionals are able to react. The risks to governments, businesses, organistations of all kinds and individuals is greater than ever<br>
 and it is only getting more dire each year that passes.<br>
<br>
Ethics in cyber security has to do with securing data, networks and systems; in order to defend the human interests that depend on them. <br>
Computer systems have direct bearing on human lives. The recent Waikato DHB cyber attack is a clear example of an information theft and <br>
ransom attack on a computer system which caused patient appointments to be cancelled and hospital systems shut down directly endangering <br>
individuals health outcomes and privacy. If those responsible did not take adequate security measures “to protect its information systems, <br>
it could be liable to any staff member, contractor or patient who suffers harm as a result”. <br>
<br>
With large companies like Google and Facebook having such a large influence in our lives, ethical considerations reach into the promotion <br>
or obfuscation of information available to individuals, censorship issues of free speech and disinformation and election campaign issues as<br>
 we have recently seen with the 2016 US election for example.<br>
<br>
I think since the high monetary and performance costs of implementing adequate security are a problem, and since governements <br>
are struggling to tackle cyber security threats; there is a feeling of recklessness and chaos in the world of computer technology and security. <br>
Malicious actors are making lots of money from attacks, and individuals and organisations suffer huge losses. I think at this time governments<br>
 of the world need to continue to work together and allocate more of their money and efforts into catching criminals and creating more effective<br>
  legal partnerships and structures. <br>
<br>
To me it seems that individual countries don’t stand much of a chance against such a truly global problem. I also get the feeling that the <br>
responsibility is on individuals and organisations to defend themselves against threats they can not reasonably defend themselves against, <br>
which looks like victim blaming to me. I think there need to be proper chains of ethical responsibilty and accountability, through much more <br>
powerful national cyber security agencies working within government and police systems combined with regulations or licenses for software <br>
and hardware for example making hardware firewalls mandatory or forcing operating system providers to certify system safety. <br>
Ultimately I don’t know much about it but I’d like to learn more.<br>
