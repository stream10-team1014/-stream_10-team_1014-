<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>
<p>
The advantage of using computers within society to perform tasks is clear. Computers are fast. Much faster than humans.<br> 
Therefore, given the appropriate instructions, they can achieve things at a great speed and accuracy of that which we cannot. <br>
Others, feel that a simpler life without advanced technology is a more peaceful life. However, with nations, organizations and <br>
most individuals constantly looking to compete with one another, this breeds a competitiveness in how efficiently we can do things. <br>
Naturally, this leads to us pushing towards advancements in technology to speed up, automate and perform all forms of tasks at an <br>
increasingly efficient rate. We look to push technology in to any area we do not have it, as we inherently have learned to believe <br>
(and this is a hard idea to dispute) that any series of tasks being achieved manually can be achieved more efficiently with the aid <br>
of computers and machines. This could be amazing for society, as there are many amazing examples of machines taking over costly tasks, <br>
reducing the cost of creating a product or offering a service. With this greater economic efficiency, it allows us the potential to <br>
live in a world where life is easier. Where a job that typically takes weeks, can days minutes. Where harvesting a crop may require hours <br>
and hours of intensive, costly labour, it might take next to none at all. This sounds amazing, however it creates two major instances of <br>
potentially crippling problems within our society, that could devastate us if left unchecked. <br><br>

The first problem is wealth diversity, and I don’t just mean money. I mean the wealth of freedom and ease that technology can provide, <br>
however money is also certainly a major part of it. The advantages of these great leaps forward in automation and computing only benefit <br>
the few in possession or control of the machines themselves. For example, if the cost of harvesting a crop is reduced by replacing manual <br>
tasks with automated machinery, this may greatly reduce the cost involved in selling said harvest. However, the person in control of the <br>
equipment has a decision to make. Do they pass on the freedom and ease that his technology offers him on to others by offering a cheaper <br>
product? Or do they simply keep the extra profit margin for themselves. In part, this leads to another sub-problem of this problem. What <br>
happens to all the people working the farm, or driving the trucks, or packing the boxes that have been made redundant by these machines? <br>
If the gains of the advanced technology were more equally spread throughout our society, the reduced income may not matter. However, due to <br>
human nature and greed, I suspect that may not be the case. <br>
	<br>
The second problem, and the one more directly related to this topic, is our dependency. From the way we communicate, finance, manufacturing, <br>
exploration, data gathering/processing for insights in to our environment… Every element of our life is manipulated by technology. Right down <br>
to what we see every day on our computers. Our opinions, our emotions and our physical health are all drastically effected by technology in a <br>
way that we have become complacent with. It is simply a part of day to day life for most people in the 21st century, and we seem to be mostly <br>
ok with that. However, what were to happen if the automation of these machines, the decisions that are being made for us, or the security that <br>
protects us from digital theft or blackmail becomes malicious? While machines have introduced great good in to our world, they can be used to <br>
cause great harm, and it is extremely important that we do everything we can to stop that from happening, especially on a great scale. <br>
	<br>
To me, the greatest problem we face on a global level is complacency of individuals. All it takes for a potential system wide takeover, or to <br>
gain information that can be used maliciously, or to change the algorithms used in vital decision making, is for someone to become complacent, <br>
which to me is a passive but unethical act. Whenever I discuss the issues of cybersecurity with most people, they’re typically aware of the threats. <br>
However, nobody seems to think anything bad will ever actually happen to them, and they pay very little attention to the very simple but important <br>
steps required to staying safe against the vast majority of digital attacks. This being said, reading online and talking with others has also led <br>
me to believe that organizations and nations (or large groups of people) do take these issues seriously and spend great amounts of money on protecting <br>
their assets and information. However, there’s two problems here. The first problem is we are not adapting to the rapidly evolving threats of malicious <br>
attackers fast enough. The second problem, is the objective stance of the organization or nation that takes security seriously, doesn’t reflect the <br>
stance of every individual that is within that group. All it takes to negatively effect a system on a great level in many cases, is ONE complacent individual. <br>
One individual who leaves the door to the server room unlocked on a bathroom break. One individual who uses a USB stick their friend gave them on a <br>
work computer. One individual to trust their outdated antivirus. One individual to open the wrong email. One individual to download the wrong file.<br>
Technology can be used for great good. It can also be used for great bad. With ease of access to such power that modern technology affords us, its is <br>
becoming ever more crucial that we protect the intent of use behind our technology with the most scrutiny. And we need to speed up. Because I believe, <br>
that complacency is leading those with good intentions to adapt less quickly than those with bad. And as we become more dependant on tech, the opportunity <br>
for great reward for malicious players becomes greater every year, further encouraging the rapid acceleration of unethical computing.<br>
